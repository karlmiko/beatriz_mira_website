          <p>I’m a Brazilian journalist who is currently pursuing a PhD in Communication and Media Studies at the University of Oregon, in the United States, as an associate at the Center for Science Communication Research. I’ve earned my Master’s degree from Kent State University, and my Bachelors in Journalism from the Pontifical Catholic University of Paraná, in my hometown of Curitiba, and the Central University of Catalonia, in Spain. My passion for nature storytelling precedes my work as an academic in science and environmental communication, and stems from my work as a photographer in Brazil, which made me realize the role of communicators as actors of social change, and curious about how well-crafted messaging can lead to practical behavior change. </p>
          <p>I understood that exceptionally created content could be a powerful transformation agent, and I admired the professionals that chose to be out there in the wild, showing us what we could never access on our own, and how crucial it was for us to care. As I advanced in the world of storytelling, more and more questions about the process and its effectiveness came up. What drives behavior change? What are the best strategies that lead to concrete action? I then started doing research in environmental communication, guided by the desire to understand what makes a message entertaining, informative, and persuasive.</p>
          <p>I want to explore the nuances of our role in spreading scientific knowledge to those who are most vulnerable to pressing environmental risks, which include marginalized communities in the Global South, taking an active part in bringing the field to a global level. Being a country of stark socioeconomic and racial inequality, but also extraordinary cultural, racial and biodiversity, the study of how Brazilian institutions approach environmental communication and solutions in different sectors of society can be extremely informative to all.</p>
          <p>It is important to me that I use my privilege of being part of the North American/European academic “bubble,” to become one of the (still too few) South American voices in this field. This includes the challenges of communicating science while dealing with the inherent uncertainty of it; emotion, persuasion, and behavior connected to environmental communication; notions of self-efficacy in pro-environmental behavior; media effects; interpersonal communication influence, and more.</p>
          <p>As a professional, I strive to balance theory, practice, and education. What we learn in academia can be incredibly informative for practice, and having that hands-on experience can make us ask better questions. An educator that can navigate both worlds can better prepare their students in a comprehensive way. As a person, I just want to be useful, and do what I can to take care of our planet.</p>
